## JavaScript Quiz App

This application is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. I have built a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. Once the game starts, the time (which is the score) goes down by 1 point every second. Every time the user gets the incorrect choice, the score decreases by 10. The game is to complete all the questions with higher scores (i.e. less incorrect choices, higher the score.)

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive powered by Bootstrap, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
